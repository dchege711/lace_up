Following this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41144565/flask-does-not-see-change-in-js-file) from Stack Overflow, hit `Cmd+Shift+R` for MacOS to force a hard refresh any time you change files and wish to see the changes in the browser immediately.

:soon: Once a user registers, take them to their account directly instead of making them log in once more.

:soon: Clicking on the logo shouldn't log the user out.

:soon: Change the home page to remove the Tiger Rides stuff.
