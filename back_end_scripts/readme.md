# Server Side Scripts

## To-Do Items

:soon: Complete the email verification step for new accounts.

* The verification shouldn't block usage of the application. Tell the user that they need to verify their account within 7 days. Let them log in and carry on.

:soon: Agree on payload for registering new users.

* I think that the user should not submit information about new games as they register for an account. Let them do that once they're within the app.

:soon: Guest demo.

* Why should someone make an account? Let prospective users have a feel of what they are up for without making any commitment.

:hourglass: Adapt the server side scripts from Tiger Rides to suit Sport Together.

* Already adapted enough code for essential features of games and accounts. I still need to set up the email client and the app handler scripts.
